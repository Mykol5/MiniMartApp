# üõí MiniMart ‚Äì eCommerce Preview App

This is a functional mobile application developed using **React Native (Expo)**. It was built based on a Figma design prototype for an eCommerce app as part of a mobile developer assessment. The app consists of three core screens: **Product Listing**, **Product Details**, and **Cart**, along with smooth navigation and state management for the cart functionality.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to:
- Convert a Figma design into a functional mobile app
- Accurately match the provided UI design
- Implement navigation and state management
- Demonstrate reusable component structure and cart functionality

## Figma Design

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MiniMartApp.git
cd MiniMartApp

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
